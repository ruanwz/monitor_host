This project builds a monitoring system to check the average load on the host.

The system consists of two parts: the client sends the info from the host and the server which receives the data and displays the data with the charts.

The client only run command on the linux host to get the info of mac and the average load, then it send to the server using the REST interface

The server have two functions: Webservice to receive the data and a user portal to view the data.

I have made some scaffold controllers, and need to clean up the unused ones later.

I have the following questions:

1 How to run the client as a daemon or just use it in the cron job?
2 If I want to use SSL to encrypt the data, how to do that? Just enable the HTTPS is enough?
3 I have installed the capybara gems in the project but still not get ready to design in the BDD way. And how to test the charts? I have used the highcharts js library to display the data.
